Pressure Changer
================

The IDAES Pressure Changer model represents a unit operation with a single stream of material which undergoes a change in pressure due to the application of a work. The Pressure Changer model contains support for a number of different thermodynamic assumptions regarding the working fluid.

Degrees of Freedom
------------------

Pressure Changer units generally have one or more degrees of freedom, depending on the thermodynamic assumption used.

Typical fixed variables are:

* outlet pressure, :math:`P_{ratio}` or :math:`\Delta P`,
* unit efficiency (isentropic or pump assumption).

Model Structure
---------------

The core Pressure Changer unit model consists of a single control volume (named ControlVolume0DBlock), a state block, containing the states, one Inlet Port (named inlet) and one Outlet Port (named outlet).

Variables
---------

Pressure Changers contain the following Variables (not including those contained within the control volume Block):

=========================== ===================== ===================================================================================
Variable                    Name                  Notes
=========================== ===================== ===================================================================================
:math:`P_{ratio}`           ratioP
:math:`V_t`                 volume                Only if has_rate_reactions = True, reference to control_volume.rate_reaction_extent
:math:`W_{mechanical,t}`    work_mechanical       Reference to control_volume.work
:math:`W_{fluid,t}`         work_fluid            Pump assumption only
:math:`\eta_{pump,t}`       efficiency_pump       Pump assumption only
:math:`W_{isentropic,t}`    work_isentropic       Isentropic assumption only
:math:`\eta_{isentropic,t}` efficiency_isentropic Isentropic assumption only
=========================== ===================== ===================================================================================

Isentropic Pressure Changers also have an additional Property Block named `properties_isentropic` (attached to the Unit Model).

Constraints
-----------

In addition to the Constraints written by the Control Volume block, Pressure Changer writes additional Constraints which depend on the thermodynamic assumption chosen. All Pressure Changers add the following Constraint to calculate the pressure ratio:

.. math:: P_{ratio,t} \times P_{in,t} = P_{out,t}

Isothermal Assumption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The isothermal assumption writes one additional Constraint:

.. math:: T_{out} = T_{in}

Adiabatic Assumption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The isothermal assumption writes one additional Constraint:

.. math:: H_{out} = H_{in}

Isentropic Assumption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The isentropic assumption creates an additional set of Property Blocks (indexed by time) for the isentropic fluid calculations (named properties_isentropic). This requires a set of balance equations relating the inlet state to the isentropic conditions, which are shown below:

.. math:: F_{in,t,p,j} = F_{out,t,p,j}
.. math:: s_{in,t} = s_{isentropic,t}
.. math:: P_{in,t} \times P_{ratio,t} = P_{isentropic,t}

where :math:`F_{t,p,j}` is the flow of component :math:`j` in phase :math:`p` at time :math:`t` and :math:`s` is the specific entropy of the fluid at time :math:`t`.

Next, the isentropic work is calculated as follows:

.. math:: W_{isentropic,t} = \sum_p{H_{isentropic,t,p}} - \sum_p{H_{in,t,p}}

where :math:`H_{t,p}` is the total energy flow of phase :math:`p` at time :math:`t`. Finally, a constraint which relates the fluid work to the actual mechanical work via an efficiency term :math:`\eta`.

If compressor is True, :math:`W_{isentropic,t} = W_{mechanical,t} \times \eta_t`

If compressor is False, :math:`W_{isentropic,t} \times \eta_t = W_{mechanical,t}`

Pump (Incompressible Fluid) Assumption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The incompressible fluid assumption writes two additional constraints. Firstly, a Constraint is written which relates fluid work to the pressure change of the fluid.

.. math:: W_{fluid,t} = (P_{out,t}-P_{in,t})\times F_{vol,t}

where :math:`F_{vol,t}` is the total volumetric flowrate of material at time :math:`t` (from the outlet Property Block). Secondly, a constraint which relates the fluid work to the actual mechanical work via an efficiency term :math:`\eta`.

If compressor is True, :math:`W_{fluid,t} = W_{mechanical,t} \times \eta_t`

If compressor is False, :math:`W_{fluid,t} \times \eta_t = W_{mechanical,t}`
