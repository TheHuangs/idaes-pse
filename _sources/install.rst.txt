Installation using Docker
-------------------------
The simplest way to install the IDAES PSE Framework is by using
the pre-built Docker_ image.

A Docker image is essentially an embedded
instance of Linux (even if you are using Windows or Mac OSX)
that has all the code for the IDAES PSE framework
pre-installed. You can run commands and Jupyter Notebooks in that
image. This section describes how to set up your system, get the
Docker image, and interact with it.

Install Docker on your system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#. Install the community edition (CE) of Docker_ (website: https://docker.io).
#. Start the Docker daemon. How to do this will depend on your operating system.

      OS X
         You should install `Docker Desktop for Mac`_.
         Docker should have been installed to your Applications directory. Browse to it and click on it from there.
         You will see a small icon in your toolbar that indicates
         that the daemon is running.

      Linux
         Install Docker using the package manager for your OS. Then
         start the daemon. If you are using Ubuntu or a Debian-based Linux distro,
         the Docker daemon will start automatically once Docker is installed.
         For CentOS, start Docker manually, e.g., run ``sudo systemctl start docker``.

      Windows
        You should install `Docker Desktop for Windows`_.
        Docker will be started automatically.

Get the IDAES Docker image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You need to get the ready made Docker image containing the source
code and solvers for the IDAES PSE framework. This image is available
for download at a URL like "https://s3.amazonaws.com/idaes/idaes-pse/idaes-pse-docker-``VERSION``.tgz",
where ``VERSION`` is the release version. See the Releases_ page on GitHub
for information about what is different about each version.

If you want the latest version, simply use the tag "latest" as the version number.
Thus, **clicking on this link will start a download of the latest version**:
`https://s3.amazonaws.com/idaes/idaes-pse/idaes-pse-docker-latest.tgz
<https://s3.amazonaws.com/idaes/idaes-pse/idaes-pse-docker-latest.tgz>`_.

.. _Releases: https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/releases

Load the IDAES Docker image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The image you downloaded needs to be loaded into your local Docker Installation
using the `Docker load`_ command, which from the command-line looks like
this:

    docker load < idaes-pse-docker-latest.tgz

.. _Docker load: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/load/

Run the IDAES Docker image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To start the Docker image, use a graphical user interface or a console or shell
command-line interface.

From the command-line, if you want to start up the Jupyter Notebook server, e.g.
to view and run the examples and tutorials, then run this command:

.. code-block:: console

      $ docker run -p 8888:8888 -it idaes/idaes_pse
      ... <debugging output from Jupyter>
      ...
      Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
      to login with a token:
          http://(305491ce063a or 127.0.0.1):8888/?token=812a290619211bef9177b0e8c0fd7e4d1f673d29909ac254

Copy and paste the URL provided at the end of the output into a browser window
and you should get a working Jupyter Notebook. You can browse to the examples
directory under ``/home/idaes/examples`` and click on the Jupyter Notebooks to
open them.

To interact with the image directly from the command-line (console), you can run the
following command:

.. code-block:: console

      $ docker run -p 8888:8888 -it idaes/idaes_pse /bin/bash
      jovyan@10c11ca29008:~$ cd /home/idaes
      ...

Installation from source code
------------------------------
If you want to install the IDAES PSE framework from the source code, follow the
set of instructions below that are appropriate for your operating system.

.. note::

    These installation procedures are only fully tested on Debian-based Linux
    distributions.

System Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * Linux operating system
    * Python 3.6+
    * Basic GNU/C compilation tools: make, gcc/g++
    * `wget` (for downloading software)
    * `git` (for getting the IDAES source code)
    * Access to the Internet

Things you must know how to do:

    * Get root permissions via `sudo`.
    * Install packages using the package manager.

Installation steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo apt-get install gcc g++ make libboost-dev

We use a Python packaging system called Conda_.
Below are instructions for installing a minimal version of Conda, called Miniconda_.
The full version installs a large number of scientific analysis and visualization libraries
that are not required by the IDAES framework.

.. _Conda: https://conda.io/
.. _Miniconda: https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

.. code-block:: sh

    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

Create and activate a conda environment (along with its own copy of ``pip``)
for the new IDAES installation **(you will need to** ``conda activate idaes``
**when you open a fresh terminal window and wish to use IDAES)**:

.. code-block:: sh

    conda create -n idaes pip
    conda activate idaes

Obtain the source code for IDAES from GitHub:

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/IDAES/idaes.git

Download and compile the AMPL Solver Library (ASL) and external property functions;
this is required for steam properties and cubic equations of state. This step is
optional, but highly recommended.

.. code-block:: sh

    cd <Location to keep the ASL>
    wget https://ampl.com/netlib/ampl/solvers.tgz
    tar -xf solvers.tgz
    cd solvers
    ./configure
    make
    export ASL_BUILD=`pwd`/solvers/sys.x86_64.Linux
    cd <IDAES source main directory>
    make

Install the required Python packages:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python setup.py develop  # or "install"

Install ipopt.  If you have an HSL license, you may prefere to compile ipopt with HSL support.  Please see the ipopt `documentation <https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt>`_ in that case.  Otherwise ipopt can be installed with conda.

.. code-block:: sh

    conda install -c conda-forge ipopt


At this point, you should be able to launch the Jupyter Notebook server and successfully `run examples <examples.html>`_ from the ``examples`` folder:

.. code-block:: sh

    jupyter notebook

Solvers
^^^^^^^

Some of the model code depends on external solvers. The installation instructions
above include the free IPOPT_ solver. Most of the examples can run with this solver,
but a significant number of more advanced problems will not be handled well. Some
other solvers you can install that may improve (or make possible) solutions for
these models are:

    * CPLEX: a linear optimization package from `IBM <https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer>`_.
    * Gurobi: LP/MILP/MIQP, etc., solvers from `Gurobi <http://www.gurobi.com>`_.

.. _IPOPT: https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt


ASL and AMPL
""""""""""""

In some cases, IDAES uses AMPL user-defined functions written in C for property
models.  Compiling these functions is optional, but some models may not work
without them.

The AMPL solver library (ASL) is required, and can be downloaded from
from https://ampl.com/netlib/ampl/solvers.tgz.  Documentation is available at
https://ampl.com/resources/hooking-your-solver-to-ampl/.


Installation on Windows
-----------------------

.. note::

    We are NOT supporting Windows at this time. Some developers on the team have had success with the following instructions, but we do not promise that they will work for all users, nor will we prioritize helping debug problems.

Python Distribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Install `Anaconda for Windows <https://www.anaconda.com/download/#download>`_

* Add Anaconda and Anaconda scripts to the path "c:\users\<user>\Anaconda2\" and "c:\users\<user>\Anaconda2\Scripts\". To do this, search for "Edit system variables" in Windows search.  Click on "Edit system environment variables". Click on "Environment Variables". Under "System   Variables", search for the variable "Path" and click "Edit"

	.. image:: _images/install_windows_system_properties.png
	   :align: center
	   :scale: 75%



	1. For Windows 10:

	      1. In the new dialog box, click on "New" and add the path where you find the python.exe file. If you installed Anaconda2, this should be in “c:\users\<user>\Anaconda2\”. Copy the address and paste it here.


	      2. Repeat for "c:\users\<user>\Anaconda2\Scripts\".

   	2. For earlier versions:

	      1. Add path to the existing list, use semicolon as separator

	      2. Type "c:\users\<user>\Anaconda2\;c:\users\<user>\Anaconda2\Scripts\"

* Restart the command prompt and type `python`. If the path variable was added correctly, then you should be able to see the python interpreter as shown below.

   :scale: 75%

Pyomo
^^^^^
* See `instructions <http://www.pyomo.org/installation/>`_ for pyomo installation. As mentioned, you can either use the pip or the conda install methods which come included with the Anaconda distribution but conda may be preferable if you installed Anaconda.

* To install pyomo using python’s **pip** package, follow these steps:


    1. Launch the "Anaconda prompt". You can find this in the start menu under Anaconda.

    2. Navigate to the "Scripts" folder in Anaconda. Or simply type, `where pip` in the prompt. This should return 1 paths and this should be in the scripts folder.

    3. Pip install pyomo from trunk (we recommend installing the IDAES branch of pyomo)

        1. Install the master branch of PyUtilib from GitHub using pip:

           `pip.exe install git+https://github.com/PyUtilib/pyutilib`

        2. Install the master branch of Pyomo from GitHub using pip:

           `pip.exe install git+https://github.com/Pyomo/pyomo@IDAES`

* To install using python’s **conda** package, follow the following steps:


    1. Launch the "Anaconda prompt". You can find this in the start menu under Anaconda.

    2. Navigate to the "Scripts" folder in Anaconda. Or simply type, `where conda` in the prompt. This should return 2 paths and one of these should be in the scripts folder.

    3. In the scripts folder run the following commands:

        `conda.exe install -c conda-forge pyomo`

        `conda.exe install -c conda-forge pyomo.extras`
* If the installation was successful, you should see the pyomo executable listed in the Scripts folder. You can check this using the `where pyomo` command.

IDAES
^^^^^

Option 1: Download zip file
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""
* From the `IDAES <https://github.com/IDAES/idaes>`_ repository on GitHub, click on "Clone or download" on the right in green. Click on “Download zip”.

* Extract the contents in the desired directory you want IDAES in.

* Open command prompt and navigate to the folder where you extracted the contents of the IDAES repository (`cd <user>/.../<desired directory>/IDAES/`).

    1. Run: `python setup.py develop`

Option 2: Using Git
"""""""""""""""""""

* Install `git <https://git-scm.com/download/win>`_ for Windows.

* If cloning the repository from the command line, move to a directory where you want to install the IDAES repository. Then run the following command:

	1. `git clone https://github.com/IDAES/idaes.git`

* Enter your github user id and password. The git installation in 1 should have added the git executable to your system path and you should be able to execute git commands from the command line.

* Open command prompt and navigate to the folder where you extracted the contents of the IDAES repository (`cd <user>/.../<desired directory>/IDAES/`).

   1. Run: `python setup.py develop`
